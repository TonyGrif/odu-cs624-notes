# Databricks Notebooks
Notebooks provide an interactive environment for developing and running data workflows, machine learning, and ETL pipelines. Databricks notebooks are integrated with [[Apache Spark]] to operate on large datasets.
## Language Support
A default language can be selected when creating the notebook; however, differing languages can be used within the same notebook using `%{lang}` at the top of the cell. Supported languages include:
* `%python`
* `%sql`
* `%scala`
* `%r`
* `%md` for markdown
* `%sh` for shell scripting
